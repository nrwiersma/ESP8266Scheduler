# Quick Start

## Installing

You can install through the Arduino Library Manager. The package name is
**ESP8266Scheduler**.

## Usage

Include the library in your sketch

```cpp
#include <Scheduler.h>
```

In your setup function start the scheduler

```cpp
Scheduler.start(&task);

Scheduler.begin();
```

The scheduler blocks once begun, so the loop function is never called. You should instead create tasks.

# Creating a Task

Tasks are classes that should inherit the ```Task``` class. A task can define a ```loop()``` and ```setup()``` function
much as the normal Arduino standard.

```cpp
class BlinkTask : public Task {
protected:
    void setup() {
        state = HIGH;

        pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
        digitalWrite(2, state);
    }

    void loop() {
        state = state == HIGH ? LOW : HIGH;
        digitalWrite(2, state);

        delay(1000);
    }

private:
    uint8_t state;
} blink_task;
```

**IMPORTANT: Tasks must be declared globally on the stack (not a pointer). Failure to do so will crash your device.**

Tasks can run ```yield``` and ```delay``` like they normally would. These functions yield control to the scheduler
rather than the ESP8266.

### Advanced Task Functions

The ```Task``` also exposes a ```bool shouldRun()``` method that is used determine if the task loop
should be be resumed. This can be inherited to add your own logic to determine if your code should be resumed.

```cpp
bool shouldRun() {
    bool run = Task::shouldRun();

    // Your code here

    return run;
}
```

**This function handles the ```delay()``` logic. The parent method should be called.**

## Methods

### start
```
static void start(Task *task)
```
> Adds a task to the multitasking queue.

### begin
```
static void begin()
```
> Starts the scheduler. This function is "blocking". It should be the last call the ```setup``` function.
